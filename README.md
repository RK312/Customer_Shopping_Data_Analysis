## Overview : 
This dashboard is for presenting my insight to the regional manager of the Shopping Mall chain with 10 different malls. I have created a dashboard which can help me discuss the sales of these malls with my higher-ups. This will be done solely to increase the sales.

## Tool used :
- Microsoft Excel

## Result and Insights :
- I have noticed that the revenue starts increasing from 1st Quarter and there is a slight decrease in 4th Quarter.
- There is a increase in Profit By Month For January, July and October each year.
- The busiest days are Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.
- The top categories in revenue are Clothing, Shoes and Technology across all malls.
- Top categories in quantity sales are Clothing, Cosmetics, Food & Beverage. 

## Data Story :
According to my observation Souvenir, Books, Food & Beverage are the category which are making the least Net Profit Amount across all the malls. Even if the sales of Food & Beverage is good across all malls but it's coming under least Net Profit generation. We shall also try to increase the sales of Souvenir by providing some discounts or by understanding customer feedback on it.
